            <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>CARE SUPPORT AND TREATMENT (CST)</h2>
            <p>
                The Care, Support and Treatment component under the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) has been instrumental in providing access to free treatment and quality services, including psycho-social support, to the people living with HIV/AIDS. The free ART initiative launched in April 2004, has witnessed several changes in programme planning, monitoring and delivery as well as treatment regimens over the years. From being limited to the tertiary care centres, to the massive scale-up and decentralization, ART services in India have come a long way in implementing and accelerating the efforts towards improving access to treatment and retention.
            </p>
            <p>The country is committed to achieving the target 3.3 of Sustainable Development Goal of Ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030. With the aim to achieve the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, various initiatives have been planned and implemented by the National AIDS Control Program (NACP) in India to improve the quality of care and treatment services and to enhance retention and adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART).
            </p>
            <p>With the inclusion of these newer treatment and care strategies, the revised ART operational guidelines provide detailed insights on the planning, implementing, and monitoring of the programme for effective service delivery. The probable challenges in programme implementation have been well anticipated and strategies have been developed to make treatment services more patient friendly, leading to improved retention in HIV care.
            </p>
            <p>Currently, the free ART services are available across medical colleges, district hospitals and sub-district hospitals. In addition to government sector, National AIDS Control Organisation is also engaging with private sector for setting up of ART centres. As per the Gazette of India notification dated 28th October 2020, every teaching college should have ART centre.

            <p>The Differentiated service delivery model for decentralized ART services near the patient's residence. These sites could be community health centres, primary health centres, opioid substitution therapy centres; care and support centres and targeted intervention sites and other community level sites at NGOs/ CBOs/ CSOs. The goal of this model is to make the treatment services easily accessible to PLHIV and promote adherence by addressing the barriers associated with inconvenience due to frequent visits, need for long travel distance and cost to the patients. These centres are linked to a nodal ART centre and function as its outreach units. The main functions of LACs include monitoring PLHIV on ART, drug refill to patients on ART, treatment of minor OIs, identification and management of adverse effects and reinforce adherence on every visit. </p>

            <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold'>Functions of Link ART centres</h3>
            <p>The main functions of Link ART centres are indicated below: </p>
            <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>

                <li><strong>Monitoring of PLHIV on ART:</strong> LAC shall monitor the linked outpatients on ART in terms of drug adherence, adverse effects of drugs and opportunistic infections. LAC shall also be responsible for patient follow-up to maintain optimum drug adherence, prevent and trace MIS and LFU cases. Referral to the ART centre shall be required in case of major OI, serious side effect of drugs etc.</li>
                <li><strong>OI prophylaxis and treatment:</strong> Depending upon the capacity including diagnostic facilities and drugs, LAC shall identify, treat OIs and provide in-patient care whenever required. However, after stabilization/treatment, patient should be sent back to ART centre for evaluation of possible treatment failure. LAC shall also continue CPT and TPT as prescribed by nodal ART centre. Drugs for prophylaxis and treatment of common OIs like cotrimoxazole, metronidazole etc. shall be provided through the health facility. LAC in community setting which do not have facilities to manage OIs will refer the PLHIV to nodal ART centre/nearest health facility at the earliest.</li>
                <li><strong>Screening of PLHIV for TB symptoms:</strong> All PLHIV shall be screened for TB during every visit and all patients with symptoms of TB should be referred to the ART centre or NTEP facility whichever is nearest for diagnosis and if found infected with TB, should be sent back to nodal ART centre for appropriate management. HIV-TB line list should be maintained.</li>
                <li><strong>Tracing MIS and LFU:</strong> Daily due list of PLHIV on ART shall be maintained by LAC. The MIS/LFU cases shall be traced by counsellor through phone and outreach.

            {/* <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold'>SERVICE DELIVERY MECHANISM FOR CARE, SUPPORT & TREATMENT:</h3>
            <p>
                CST services are provided through dedicated ART centres established in health facilities. These are linked to Centres of Excellence (CoE) and ART Plus Centres. The services have been decentralised through Link ART Centres (LAC). ART centres are also linked to ICTCs, STI clinics, PPTCT services and other clinical departments in the institutions. They are also linked with the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), in order to ensure proper management of TB-HIV co-infected patients.
            </p>
            <h4 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Anti-Retroviral Therapy Centres:</h4>
            <p>Provision of free Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) for all persons living with HIV/AIDS.</p>
            <h4 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Link ART Centres:</h4>
            <p>
                In order to facilitate the delivery of ART services closer to the beneficiaries, Link ART Centres (LAC) was set up mainly at ICTCs in the district/sub-district level hospitals and linked to a Nodal ART centre within accessible distance. The LACs help in reducing cost of travel; time spent at the centre and hence helps in improving clients’ adherence to ART.
            </p>
            <h4 className='text-lg font-semibold'>ART Plus Centres:</h4>
            <p>
                In order to provide easy access to second-line ART, NACO expanded the number of centres that provide second-line ART by upgrading some of the ART centres as ART Plus.
            </p>
            <h4 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Care and Support Centres (CSC):</h4>
            <p>Goal:</p>
            <p>
                To improve survival and quality of life of PLHIV. Care and Support Centres provide expanded and holistic care & support services for PLHIV. They provide linkages and access to essential services, support treatment adherence, reduce stigma and discrimination, and improve the quality of life of PLHIV.

            <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold'>SERVICES PROVIDED:</h3>
            <ul className='list-disc pl-5'>
                <li>
                    First-line ART: First-line ART is provided free of cost to all PLHIV through ART centres. Positive cases referred by ICTCs are registered in ART centres for pre-ART and ART services. The assessment for ART is done through clinical examination and CD4 count. Patients are also provided Counseling on treatment adherence, nutrition, positive prevention and positive living. Follow up of patients on ART is done by assessing drug adherence, regularity of visits, periodic examination and CD4 count (every six months). Treatment for Opportunistic Infections is also provided through ART centres.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alternative first-line ART: It has been observed that a small number of patients initiated on first-line ART experience acute/chronic toxicity/intolerance to first-line ARV drugs, thus necessitating change of ARV drugs to alternative first-line drugs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second-line ART: The patients started on ART can continue on first-line ART for a number of years if their adherence is good. However, over the years some percentage of PLHIV on first-line ART develops resistance to these drugs due to mutations in the virus. For the evaluation of patients for initiation on second line and alternate first-line ART, a State AIDS Clinical Expert Panel (SACEP) has been constituted.
