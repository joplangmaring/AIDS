            In November 1999, the second National AIDS Control Project (NACP II) was launched with World Bank credit support of USD 191 million. The policy and strategic shift was reflected in the two key objectives of NACP II: (i) to reduce the spread of HIV infection in India, and (ii) to increase Indiaâ€™s capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS on a long-term basis. Key policy initiatives taken during NACP II included: adoption of National AIDS Prevention and Control Policy (2002); Scale up of Targeted Interventions for High risk groups in high prevalence states; Adoption of National Blood Policy; a strategy for Greater Involvement of People with HIV/AIDS (GIPA); launch of National Adolescent Education Programme (NAEP); introduction of counseling, testing and PPTCT programmes; Launch of National Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) programme; formation of anointer-ministerial group for mainstreaming; and setting up of the National Council on AIDS, chaired by the Prime Minister; and setting up of State AIDS Control Societies in all states.</p>
