                Indiaâ€™s AIDS Control Programme is globally acclaimed as a success story. The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), launched in 1992, is being implemented as a comprehensive programme for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in India. Over time, the focus has shifted from raising awareness to behavior change, from a national response to a more decentralized response, and to increasing involvement of NGOs and networks of People Living with HIV (PLHIV).

                In 1992, the Government launched the first National AIDS Control Programme (NACPI) with an IDA Credit of USD 84 million and demonstrated its commitment to combat the disease. NACP I was implemented with the objective of slowing down the spread of HIV infections to reduce morbidity, mortality, and the impact of AIDS in the country. The National AIDS Control Board (NACB) was constituted, and an autonomous National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) was set up to implement the project. The first phase focused on awareness generation, setting up a surveillance system for monitoring the HIV epidemic, and measures to ensure access to safe blood and preventive services for high-risk group populations.
