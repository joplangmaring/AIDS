      <p>
        Talk to your partners and friends about condoms. There are more HIV
        prevention options than ever before, and condoms are still a highly
        effective option to prevent both HIV and other sexually transmitted
        diseases (STDs).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use them the right way every time you have sex, condoms are
        highly effective in preventing HIV infection. But itâ€™s important to
        educate yourself about how to use them the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Condoms can also help prevent other STDs you can get through body
        fluids, like gonorrhea and chlamydia. However, they provide less
        protection against STDs spread through skin-to-skin contact, like human
        papillomavirus or HPV (genital warts), genital herpes, and syphilis.
