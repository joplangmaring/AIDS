            <h3 className='text-xl font-bold'>1: Intensifying and Consolidating Prevention Services</h3>
            <p>
                This component will support the scaling up of Targeted Interventions (TIs) to reach hard-to-reach population groups who do not yet access and use the prevention services of the program, aiming to saturate coverage among High-Risk Groups (HRGs). Additionally, it will support the bridge population, i.e., migrants and truckers. Component 1 includes the following two subcomponents:
            </p>

            <h4 className='font-bold'>1.1 Scaling up coverage of TIs among HRG</h4>
            <p>
                The interventions under this sub-component will include: 
                <ol className='list-decimal list-inside'>
                    <li>Provision of behavior change interventions to increase safe practices, testing and counseling, and adherence to treatment.</li>
                    <li>Promotion and provision of condoms to HRGs for use in each sexual encounter.</li>
                    <li>Provision or referral for STI services, including counseling at service provision centers to increase compliance of patients with treatment.</li>
                    <li>Needle and syringe exchange for IDUs and scaling up of Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST).</li>
                    <li>Financing of operating costs for about 25 State Training Resource Centers and participant training costs over 5 years.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h4 className='font-bold'>1.2 Scaling up of interventions among other vulnerable populations</h4>
            <p>
                The activities under this subcomponent will include:
                <ol className='list-decimal list-inside'>
                    <li>Risk assessment and size estimation of migrant population groups and truckers at transit points and workplaces.</li>
                    <li>Behavior change communications (BCC) for creating awareness about risk and vulnerability, prevention methods, and availability of services.</li>
                    <li>Promotion and provisioning of condoms through various channels, including social marketing.</li>
                    <li>Development of linkages with local institutions for testing, counseling, and STI treatment services.</li>
                    <li>Creation of “peer support groups” and “safe spaces” for migrants at destinations.</li>
                    <li>Establishment of need-based and gender-sensitive services for partners of IDUs.</li>
                    <li>Strengthening networks of vulnerable populations with enhanced linkages to service centers and risk reduction interventions, specifically condom use.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3 className='text-xl font-bold'>2: Expanding IEC Services</h3>
            <p>
                IEC has been an important component of the NACP. With the expansion of services for counseling and testing, ART, STI treatment, and condom promotion, demand generation campaigns will continue to be the focus of the NACP-IV communication strategy. IEC will include:
                <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
                    <li>Behavior change communication strategies for HRGs, vulnerable groups, and hard-to-reach populations.</li>
                    <li>Increasing awareness among the general population, particularly women and youth.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 className='text-xl font-bold'>3: Comprehensive Care, Support, and Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                NACP IV will implement comprehensive HIV care for all those in need and facilitate additional support systems for women and children affected and infected with HIV/AIDS. It is envisaged that greater adherence and compliance will be possible with a wide network of treatment facilities and collaborative support from PLHIV and civil society groups. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional Centers of Excellence (CoEs) and upgraded ART Plus centers will be established to provide high-quality treatment and follow-up services, positive prevention, and better linkages with healthcare providers. NACP IV will address increasing demands for 2nd line ART and opportunistic infection management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comprehensive care, support, and treatment will include:
                <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
                    <li>Anti-retroviral treatment (ART), including second line.</li>
                    <li>Management of opportunistic infections.</li>
                    <li>Facilitating social protection through linkages with concerned Departments/Ministries.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 className='text-xl font-bold'>4: Strengthening Institutional Capacities</h3>
            <p>
                The objective of NACP IV is to consolidate the reversal of the epidemic at the national level to all key districts in India. Programme planning and management responsibilities will be strengthened at state and district levels to ensure high quality and effective implementation of activities and desired outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Planning processes and systems will be further strengthened to ensure that annual action plans are based on evidence, local priorities, and NACP IV objectives. Sustaining the epidemic response through increased collaboration with other departments will be prioritized during NACP IV, involving phased integration of HIV services with public sector health delivery systems.
            </p>

            <h3 className='text-xl font-bold'>5: Strategic Information Management Systems (SIMS)</h3>
            <p>
                The roll-out of SIMS is ongoing and will be established at all levels to support evidence-based planning, program monitoring, and measuring of programmatic impacts. The surveillance system will be further strengthened to track the epidemic, conduct incidence analysis, identify pockets of infection, and estimate the burden of infection. Research priorities will also be customized to the emerging needs of the program. NACP IV will document, manage, and disseminate evidence and utilize programmatic and research data effectively.
