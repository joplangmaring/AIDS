            <p>
                Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI) enhance the chances of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. Hence, control and prevention of STI/RTI is a key strategy in HIV prevention. Early diagnosis and complete treatment of STI/RTI can reduce HIV transmission rates by over 40%. Managing these infections also reduces reproductive morbidity and improves quality of life, particularly for women and adolescents. The cornerstone of STI/RTI management under the National AIDS Control Organization is Syndromic case management, which uses minimal laboratory tests.

            <h2 className='text-3xl font-semibold'>Progress of STI/RTI Services</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Expansion of STI/RTI Services in Government Health Facilities:</strong> There are currently 10 Designated STI/RTI Clinics (DSRC) supported by the Meghalaya State AIDS Control Society. DSRC services are available through the Obstetrics & Gynecology OPD and STI OPD under the Dermato-Venereology clinic. These clinics, supported by the SACS, are equipped to provide quality STI/RTI services with privacy measures, specialized furniture, examination instruments, centrally supplied color-coded STI/RTI drug kits, RPR kits for Syphilis testing, consumables for basic lab tests, and computers for record-keeping and reporting. Each clinic also has a trained counselor.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Pre-packed STI/RTI Color-Coded Kits:</strong> The pre-packaging of STI/RTI drug kits has standardized treatment across clinics. These color-coded kits are provided for free at government STI/RTI clinics and TI NGOs, procured by NACO, and distributed centrally. This global innovation in STI program management aids in consistent care delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>New Strategy on Elimination of Parent-to-Child Transmission of Syphilis:</strong> Congenital Syphilis, though serious, is preventable. By screening all pregnant mothers for syphilis and treating those infected, along with their partners and newborns, we can proactively work toward its elimination.
